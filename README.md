# KKT    
This is an easy python script, created to automize my tedious work when i was still a procurement buyer. 👦🏻   
It functions as a spider, only to open a bunch of merely-change URLs according to purchasing order numbers.   
I named it **KKT**,which means KuaiKuaiTang（快快唐）, ***a convenient tool created by Tang***.⚡
