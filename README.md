# KKT
This is an easy python script, created to automize my tedious work when i was still a procurement buyer in manufatoring field.
It functions as a spider, only to open a bunch of merely-change URLs according to purchasing order numbers.
I named it **KKT**,which means KuaiKuaiTang（快快唐）,*** a quick tool created by Tang***.
